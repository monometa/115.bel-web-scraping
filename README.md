# Temp repository for solving problem 

I want to parse districts from this site - https://115.xn--90ais/ -> (Tab "Статистика") but got stuck.

For the current period, I can only get data for a single region, but as soon as I try to run this in a loop, the site gives duplicate data for one region for all others

In [this](https://github.com/monometa/115.bel-web-scraping/blob/main/problem_get_districtsv.py) script u can find my sample of code

That [file](https://github.com/monometa/115.bel-web-scraping/blob/main/districts/example_brest.html) is example of good result for 1 region 

Unfortunately, I am not a web scraping guru and would appreciate any advice.
